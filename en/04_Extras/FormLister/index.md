Snippet to process forms. Though it seems to be more difficult than eForm, FormLister offers a lot of features to suit any form processing tasks:

* it can be fitted for any custom task using controllers and prepare snippets;
* DocLister template engine;
* lexicons;
* it does not depend on forms html code;
* different api modes for convenient work with template engines and ajax;
* external sources of data (arrays, modx placeholders, session, cookies, MODxAPI models);
* storing parameters in files.
