# EvolutionCMS documentation

* Evolution CMS is a professional website development tool that allows you to manage content (and the site itself) absolutely 100%! This system is open source, and therefore free. Unlike most free CMS on Evolution, you can build a site of any complexity, with almost any set of functions, while the system will not in any way affect your html code. *


## How to contribute
1. First of all, you must have an account on GitHub, if not - [then make it very simple](https://github.com/join).
2. Make a fork [https://github.com/evolution-cms/docs/](https://github.com/evolution-cms/docs/) to yourself by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right.
3. Clone the repository to your disk and work with it locally, like everyone else (if you are a developer)
4. If you are not a developer, you can simply edit the * .md files directly on GitHub.
5. When you have done everything, you should [make a "Pull Request"](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) and send it to send changes to this repository.
